# Summary
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography are
analytical techniques which allow for the quantitative characterization of the
chemical components of mixtures [Figure 1(A)]. Technological advancements in
sample preparation and mechanical automation have allowed HPLC to become a
high-throughput tool [@kaplitz2020; @broeckhoven2019] which poses new challenges
for reproducible and rapid analysis of the resulting chromatograms.  Here we
present `hplc-py`, a Python package that permits rapid and reliable quantitation
of component signals within a chromatogram for pipelined workflows. This is
achieved by a signal detection and quantitation algorithm which i) identifies
windows of time which contain peaks and ii) infers the parameters of a mixture
of amplitude-weighted skew-normal distributions which sum to reconstruct the
observed signal. This approach is particularly effective at deconvolving highly
overlapping signals, allowing for precise absolute quantitation of chemical
constituents with similar chromatographic retention times.

# Statement of Need 
Chromatography has become a gold-standard method across diverse fields for
precise quantitation and separation of chemical mixtures. A key objective in the
analysis of chromatographic data is determining the time-integrated signal of
each component, a process which becomes challenging when chemically-similar
components result in strongly overlapping signals [such as the blue and green
symbols in Figure 1(B)].  As of this writing, many of the available tools for
signal quantification, such as the open source Python 2.7 software `HappyTools`
[@jansen2018], Microsoft Excel applications [@cruzvillalon2023], or proprietary
solutions such as [Chromeleon by Thermo-Fisher
](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/CHROMELEON7) and [Empower
by
Waters](https://www.waters.com/waters/en_US/Empower-3-Chromatography-Data-Software/nav.htm?cid=513188&locale=en_US),
rely on manual processing of the chromatograms and
curation of the resulting quantitative data. Furthermore, we are unaware of any
tools that can reliably deconvolve highly overlapping signals. `hplc-py`
provides a programmatic interface by which users can quickly and reliably
quantify components of complex chromatograms in a few lines of code [Figure
1(C)]. Importantly, the peak detection and fitting algorithm of `hplc-py` is
able to deconvolve completely overlapping signals, allowing for the accurate
quantification of mixtures otherwise not separable without extensive
experimental optimization.

# Methodology 
The core algorithmic steps employed by `hplc-py` are diagrammed in Figure 2 and 
presented in detail on the package
[documentation](https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py). Nearly all functions of
`hplc-py` are methods on a base `Chromatogram` object [Figure 2(A)]. Once a
`Chromatogram` has been instantiated, automated detection and quantification of
peaks which compose the observed chromatogram can be executed by calling the
`.fit_peaks` method. Under the hood, this method calls three helper functions
[diagrammed in Figure 2(B)] which preform the following steps:

**`i)` Estimation of and correction for a variable baseline.** A common challenge in the analysis of HPLC data is the identification and removal of spurious 
background signal. While the physicochemical basis for baseline variance is complex [@choikhet2003; @felinger2004], numerous methods have been developed for their correction [@mecozzi2014; @macko2001]. In `hplc-py`, this is implemented using the Sensitive Nonlinear Iterative Peak (SNIP) method originally developed for smoothing 
of spectroscopic data [@morhac2008].

**`ii)` Peak identification and separation of the chromatogram into region windows.** After any variable 
background has been identified and corrected, peak-filled regions of the chromatogram are identified
through the application of topographic prominence thresholds, a method common in the signal processing 
of neuron action potentials [@choi2017]. With peak locations identified, the chromatogram 
is further clipped into windows--regions in time where chemical species co-elute 
and therefore overlap.

**`iii)` Fitting a mixture of amplitude-weighted skew-normal distributions to each peak window.** For an assigned peak window with $N$ peaks, `hplc-py` fits a convolution of $N$ amplitude-weighted skew-normal 
distributions to the observed signal $S$ within that window. A weighted skew-normal distribution is parameterized 
by an amplitude $A$, location and scale parameters $\tau$ and $\sigma$, and a skew parameter $\alpha$ and has 
the form 
$$
S(t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left[-\frac{(t - \tau)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{\alpha(t - \tau)}{\sqrt{2\sigma^2}}\right)\right], \label{eq:skewnorm}
$$
where $t$ is the time point and $\text{erf}$ is the error function. The skew-normal 
distribution is useful in fitting chromatogram signals as peaks are often asymmetric 
with high skewness, a property described by a single parameter $\alpha$.

The `.fit_peaks` method returns a Pandas DataFrame [Figure 2(C)] which reports the 
best-fit values for each parameter for each peak. Importantly, it also returns 
the integral of Equation 1 for each compound over a given time window which is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte [@moosavi2018]. Figure 2(D-E) demonstrates that the
peak quantification algorithm of `hplc-py` yields a linear relationship between concentration and 
integrated area for a standard curve of a lactose sugar solution across a decade of concentrations.

# Constraining Peak Parameters and Overlapping Signals
The separation efficiency of different chemical species through HPLC is dependent
on myriad variables, including chemical properties of the column, the solvent, the 
operational temperature, and column dimensions. It is 
common for some chemical species to co-elute in a given experimental configuration. 
For example, the sugar lactose [Figure 3(A, blue)] and inorganic ion phosphate [Figure 3(A, purple)] have almost identical elution times on a [Rezex Organic Acid H+ 8% column](https://www.phenomenex.com/products/rezex-hplc-column/rezex-roa-organic-acid-h) with a 2.5 mM H$_2$SO$_4$ mobile phase, resulting 
in a convolution which can be mistaken for a single peak [Figure 3(A, dashed line)].
As a consequence, these signals would be classified as inseparable using other 
HPLC data analysis programs and further experimental optimization would be needed 
to resolve them. 

However, as `hplc-py` fits mixtures of weighted distributions instead 
of empirically summing over the signal itself, it is possible to quantitatively 
resolve these signals. This can be performed by tightly constraining the
parameters of one of the two confounding signals, such as phosphate.
As an example, we have considered a use case where phosphate is present in a fixed 
concentration across samples whereas the lactose concentration can vary. Under such 
a scenario, `hplc-py` can be used to independently characterize the parameters 
which define the size and shape of the phosphate peak [Figure 3(B)]. With these 
parameters in hand, one can tightly constrain the parameter regimes (as described in
the [`hplc-py` documentation](https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py/tutorials/quickstart.html#Constraining-Peaks-With-Known-Parameters)) for
the phosphate signal within a mixture [Figure 3(C)], allowing for effective estimation of parameter
values for the lactose peak. Using this approach and the lactose calibration curve shown in Figure 2(E),
we were able to measure the lactose concentration within a wide range of lactose-phosphate mixtures 
with quantitative accuracy [Figure 3(D)]. Such accuracy is lost when parameters for both the phosphate 
and lactose peaks are allowed to be freely estimated [Figure 3(F)], even though the inferred 
chromatogram reconstruction is in agreement with the observed signal [Figure 3(E)].

compared to the known concentration in the mixture for the constrained and unconstrained
phosphate parameters are shown in (E) and (F), respectively. Code used to perform this analysis and generate these figures is available on the [GitHub repository publication branch](https://github.com/cremerlab/hplc-py/blob/publication/Fig3_validation.py)](figures/Figure3.png)

In total, `hplc-py` provides a programmatic interface that allows experimentalists 
to rapidly quantify chemical signals from chromatograms, even when there is exceedingly
high overlap between analytes. While we have tailored the default parameters of the 
`hplc-py` methods to be amenable to typical HPLC chromatographic outputs, we have 
also made it simple to [manually adjust different aspects of the peak quantification 
algorithm](https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py/quant.html#hplc.quant.Chromatogram.fit_peaks), including parameters controlling the degree of background subtraction, the constraint of fitting parameters, and even enforcing the estimation of peaks with low topographic prominence. Additionally, we have developed 
[heuristics the user can employ to assess quality of the reconstruction](https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py/methodology/scoring.html), though we emphasize that this is not to be used as 
a measure of uncertainty. We hope that `hplc-py` can act as a tool that can make
scientific interpretation of results, rather than their generation, the next bottleneck 
in HPLC-based experiments.
