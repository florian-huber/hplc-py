  abstract   = {High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is widely used for absolute quantitation. The advent of new columns and HPLC technology has enabled higher sample throughput, and hence, larger scale studies that perform quantitation on different sample types (e.g. healthy controls vs. patients with rheumatoid arthritis) using HPLC are becoming feasible. However, there remains a lack of methods that can analyse the increased number of HPLC samples. To address this in part, the modular toolkit HappyTools has been developed for the high-throughput targeted quantitation of HPLC measurements. HappyTools enables the user to create an automated workflow that includes retention time (tr) calibration, data extraction and the calculation of several quality criteria for data curation. HappyTools has been tested on a biopharmaceutical standard and previously published clinical samples. The results show comparable accuracy between HappyTools, Waters Empower and ThermoFisher Chromeleon. However, HappyTools offered superior precision and throughput when compared with Waters Empower and ThermoFisher Chromeleon. HappyTools is released under the Apache 2.0 license, both the source code and a Windows binary can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Tarskin/HappyTools.},

In this study, baseline noise is characterized by calculating its power spectrum and wavelet transform using frontal chromatograms. Wavelet analysis is a very powerful means to detect the heteroscedastity or homoscedasticity of the baseline. Usually, it is assumed that noise level is proportional to signal intensity. This is, however, a rather rough estimation. Our calculations show that noise intensity is neither constant nor directly proportional to the signal intensity.},

The proposed algorithm, based on a polynomial fitting estimation of the baseline, has been applied to the GC analysis of the hydrocarbon content in marine sediments.},

Moreover, some pressure effects may be exploited for HPLC column diagnostics, and pressure may even be employed to control retention behaviour of substances. Last but not least, ultrahigh pressure enables transporting eluent through long microparticulate column packings to reach extremely high efficiency of HPLC separations.},

We have proposed several improvements of the SNIP algorithm. Moreover, we have extended and generalized the SNIP algorithm for multidimensional coincidence γ-ray spectra. In addition to the continuous background, the so-called lower-order coincidences, i.e., coincidences peak-background in different dimensions, must also be included into the estimated background. Further, we have derived a set of modifications of the algorithm that allow estimation of specific shapes of background and ridges as well.},

  abstract = {Objective. Direct stimulation of retinal ganglion cells in degenerate retinas by implanting epi-retinal prostheses is a recognized strategy for restoration of visual perception in patients with retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration. Elucidating the best stimulus-response paradigms in the laboratory using multielectrode arrays (MEA) is complicated by the fact that the short-latency spikes (within 10 ms) elicited by direct retinal ganglion cell (RGC) stimulation are obscured by the stimulus artifact which is generated by the electrical stimulator. Approach. We developed an artifact subtraction algorithm based on topographic prominence discrimination, wherein the duration of prominences within the stimulus artifact is used as a strategy for identifying the artifact for subtraction and clarifying the obfuscated spikes which are then quantified using standard thresholding. Main results. We found that the prominence discrimination based filters perform creditably in simulation conditions by successfully isolating randomly inserted spikes in the presence of simple and even complex residual artifacts. We also show that the algorithm successfully isolated short-latency spikes in an MEA-based recording from degenerate mouse retinas, where the amplitude and frequency characteristics of the stimulus artifact vary according to the distance of the recording electrode from the stimulating electrode. By ROC analysis of false positive and false negative first spike detection rates in a dataset of one hundred and eight RGCs from four retinal patches, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of a generally-used artifact subtraction filter algorithm which uses a strategy of local polynomial approximation (SALPA). Significance. We conclude that the application of topographic prominence discrimination is a valid and useful method for subtraction of stimulation artifacts with variable amplitudes and shapes. We propose that our algorithm may be used as stand-alone or supplementary to other artifact subtraction algorithms like SALPA.},

Some statistical analyses are required to choose the best model fitting to the experimental data and also evaluate the linearity and homoscedasticity of the calibration curve. Using an internal standard corrects for the loss of analyte during sample preparation and analysis provided that it is selected appropriately. After the best regression model is selected, the analytical method needs to be validated using quality control (QC) samples prepared and stored in the same temperature as intended for the study samples. Most of the international guidelines require that the parameters, including linearity, specificity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), matrix effect and stability, be assessed during validation. Despite the highly regulated area, some challenges still exist regarding the validation of some analytical methods including methods when no analyte-free matrix is available.},
